# Web

The website content is created in Markdown and uses the [Jekyll][] website generator.

In order to preview the website locally, [install Jekyll][jekyll-install], then in the directory where you checked out this project:

```
$ jekyll serve
â€¦
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

In order to generate the static html for the site

```
$ jekyll build
```

The html is generated in the `_site` directory.
